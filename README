# XenoTech Common Library
by Tom Everaarts and Folkert van Verseveld

Link with this library by adding -lxtcommon (or libxtcommon.a) when
building your program!

This library is cross platform, however there are some problems.
All functions which exhibit problems on certain platforms have this
noted in their documentation.
On Windows all snprintf calls currently have a bug: If the buffer is
too small, no null-terminator will be appended. This is because of
Windows's major suckage. They do not honor the C standard.

Dependencies:
When using this library, you need to link with other libraries as
well... This is explained below.
Read this correctly! You do not need to link with everything if certain
library functions are not used!

The minimum versions listed below ensure that everything should work
flawlessly. Most depedencies are present by default on all systems.

Just type (without quotes) "./configure && make" and everything should
be done! If you want to install the library on your system for easy use
in other programs, type (without quotes) "make install".

Several demo programs reside in the "demos" folder. The procedure for
compiling these is the same as for the main library.
