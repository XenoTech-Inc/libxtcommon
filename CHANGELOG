0.9.0.:
------
New stuff:
- Printf family added. These offer the same features as printf on Linux.
  * xtfprintf
  * xtprintf
  * xtsnprintf
  * xtvfprintf
  * xtvprintf
  * xtvsnprintf
- Proc API extended
  * Added xtProcGetName()
  * Added xtProcGetPids()
- Big time API overhaul. View the API changes for more info!
- xtRot13 is now branchless. This is a major performance gain!

API changes:
- All Windows code now uses xtsnprintf in favor of snprintf because snprintf is
  broken on Windows. The string is not always null-terminated.
- The File API now recognizes more file types.
- Time API overhaul
  * Accuracy of time retrieval functions has been increased up to nanoseconds
  * More clock types are now supported
  * Timestamps now use the new struct xtTimestamp instead of unsigned long long
  * struct xtDate created for convenient date / datetime conversion
  * Old time retrieval functions removed in favor of xtClockGetTime()

Removed:
- _base.h because it is no longer necessary thanks to the header inclusion style.
- xtFileGetPathFromFilePointer() because it was unused for a long time.
- Conversion functions in string.h because the new xtprintf family essentially
  replaces them, including: xtSizetToStr(), xtUint64ToStr() and xtInt64ToStr().

0.8.0.:
------
New stuff:
- Added string demo
- Added xtFormatBytesSI() for metric system numbers
- Added xtList*Create() destruction guards
- Added xtSeedRand() and xtRandLLU()
- Major changes in Socket API

  * Added functions to retrieve non-ready socket info

API changes:
- Added buffer length parameter to xtFormatCommasLL() and xtFormatCommasLLU()
- Changed many pointers parameters to restrict pointers
- Changed xtMutexDestroy() to always succeed
  Returning a bool is useless since it would segfault on failure
- Changed return type from xtThreadJoin() to void
- Major changes in Socket API
  Changed return type from many functions from unsigned to size_t
- Major changes with functions that take strings and buffer length
- Renamed xtClockFormatTime() to xtFormatTime()

Bugfixes:
- Fixed segfault with mutexes
- Fixed xtStringEndsWith() pointer offset underflow
- Fixed xtStringTrim() off by one error
- Fixed uninitialized data in xtConsoleFillLine()
