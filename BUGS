                         KNOWN ISSUES
-----------------------------------------------------------------

# Windows

## Building

The library does not build properly with some cross compilers for
mingw32 because the linker fails with an undefined reference to
strtok_r.

## printf, fprintf, snprintf, vsnprintf

We have provided an extended and improved printf family for multiple
types that are not supported on Windows. This also fixes proper
NULL-termination if it does not fit on Windows. This is because of
Windows's major suckage. They do not honor the C standard.

# Linux

## OS API

xtGetCPUInfo() is known to run very slow if the system is on high load.
A workaround has been written, but it is not stable and fast enough to
include in the library yet.

# Windows

## Thread API

xtThreadCreate(): Specifying a guard size has no effect since the Windows
  API has no support for such a thing.
xtThreadSetName(), xtThreadGetName(): These both have no effect on Windows.
  The Windows API has no support for thread names until Windows 10 and up.
